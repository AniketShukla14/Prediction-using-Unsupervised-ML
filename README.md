# Prediction using Unsupervised ML
<li>The idea was to perform prediction using unsupervised ML technique on ‘Iris’ dataset. It predicted the optimum numbers of clusters and 
represented it visually.</li>
<li>I used different Python libraries and Jupyter notebook for the same.</li>
<li>It was an Internship project which was highly appreciated by other colleagues.</li>


## Objective
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.
