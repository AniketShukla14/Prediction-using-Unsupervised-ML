# Prediction using Unsupervised ML
<li>The task was to perform the prediction using Unsupervised ML with ‘Iris’ dataset and predicted the optimum numbers of clusters and 
represented it visually.<li>
<li>I Used different Python libraries and Jupyter notebook for the above-mentioned task.<li>
<li>It was a Internship project which was highly appreciated by other colleagues.<li>


## Objective
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.
